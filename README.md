In addition, **use-case specific** dependencies such as firebase_core, fl_chart, synchronized, path_provider, intl, cached_network_image, url_launcher, carousel, and more. I have deliberately selected only the essential dependencies in this application to maintain a minimal app size. 

Utilizing my familiarity/expertise in Android, it was easy to **relate flutter concepts to their Android counterparts**, making it a lot easier for me to grasp the new framework.

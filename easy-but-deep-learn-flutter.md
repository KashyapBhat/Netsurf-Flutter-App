Great question — here’s a list of **basic-looking Flutter questions** that can go very deep if you answer them well (senior interviewers often test this):

---

### 1️⃣ What is a widget in Flutter?

Looks basic, but depth:

* Difference between widget, element, render object.
* Lifecycle of a widget vs element.
* How immutability enables rebuild efficiency.
* Why Flutter rebuilds entire trees but is still performant (diffing element tree).

---

### 2️⃣ What is BuildContext?

Basic, but can go deep:

* How BuildContext helps traverse the widget tree.
* Why context of one widget cannot be used in another lifecycle phase (ex: after async).
* Context vs Element vs InheritedWidget.
* How `of(context)` resolves up the tree (AncestorElementFinder).

---

### 3️⃣ What is setState?

Simple, but:

* What does setState actually do internally?
* Why excessive setState causes jank.
* How setState triggers re-render (element rebuild, not always render repaint).
* When to avoid setState — Bloc/Riverpod separation.

---

### 4️⃣ Difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget

Most asked, but:

* When to prefer Stateless with StateNotifier/Bloc for performance.
* Impact on rebuilds and testing.
* How State is preserved in Element tree.
* What happens if StatefulWidget’s key changes.

---

### 5️⃣ How does Flutter render UI?

Basic → can go deep:

* Widget → Element → RenderObject → Layer → Scene → Skia.
* Pipeline of build/layout/paint/composite.
* Why Flutter is independent of platform views (vs React Native).
* How RepaintBoundary affects layer tree.

---

### 6️⃣ What is hot reload vs hot restart?

Basic question → deeper if:

* Why hot reload preserves state.
* What is preserved vs what is reloaded.
* Limitations — static fields, DI graph, initState.
* When to choose one vs other in real dev flow.

---

### 7️⃣ What is a Future in Dart?

Simple → depth:

* How Futures use event loop (microtasks vs event queue).
* Difference between async/await vs .then().
* Future chaining — handling errors properly.
* Where you must switch to isolate (CPU-bound).

---

### 8️⃣ How does ListView\.builder work?

Normal question → depth:

* How it optimizes for memory and performance.
* What happens on offscreen elements.
* Impact of keys on list diffing.
* How to implement infinite scroll (lazy load).

---

### 9️⃣ How do you manage app state?

Very common — if you go deep:

* StatefulWidget vs Provider vs Riverpod vs Bloc.
* When to use local state vs app-wide state.
* Why you need separation of concerns for testability.
* How to scale state mgmt for large apps.

---

### 10️⃣ What is a Key in Flutter?

Basic — but depth:

* Role in matching elements during rebuild.
* LocalKey vs GlobalKey.
* Why lists need keys (reordering issues).
* Why overusing GlobalKey causes perf hits.

### 1️⃣ **How Element tree diffing works**

* Flutter doesn’t “diff” widgets → **widgets are immutable**.
* The **Element Tree** is mutable and long-lived.
* Each time a frame is built:

  * The framework **walks the old Element tree**.
  * For each widget:

    * If **runtimeType** and **Key** match → update Element, reuse RenderObject.
    * If they don’t match → destroy old Element, create new one.
* This is **O(N)** but very fast because of Element reuse.
* No “virtual DOM” needed because the Element → RenderObject is already a live structure.

→ *Why is this fast?*
Because **Widgets are config-only**, not state holders — you aren’t “patching” the DOM, you’re simply asking the Element to update itself when config changes.

---

### 2️⃣ **Why Flutter doesn’t use Virtual DOM**

* React uses Virtual DOM to diff JS objects → then update real DOM.
* Flutter **controls the rendering pipeline end-to-end**:

  * Widget → Element → RenderObject → Layer → SceneBuilder → GPU (Skia)
* No browser → no DOM.
* **Full control** = no need to simulate a DOM or diff large object trees.
* **Element tree is live and mutable** → cheaper than React’s diff.

→ *Architect’s insight:*
Virtual DOM adds overhead Flutter doesn’t need because of its custom rendering backend.

---

### 3️⃣ **State persistence & offline-first patterns**

* **Hydrated state** → Store Bloc or Riverpod state in disk (Hive, SharedPrefs, SecureStorage).
* **Offline-first:**

  * Use a **local DB** (Hive/Isar/SQLite) as first source of truth.
  * Sync with server in background.
  * Show UI from local data first → update when server returns.
* Handle **conflict resolution**:

  * Versioning, last-write-wins, or custom merge logic.

→ *Architect’s insight:*
Offline-first needs **UX-level support**: loaders, sync indicators, stale flags.

---

### 4️⃣ **Unidirectional data flow & enforcing it**

* Data flows one way:

  * User Action → Bloc/Event → UseCase/Repo → State → UI.
  * UI does not directly mutate state.
* **How to enforce:**

  * Make State immutable.
  * Expose only one source of truth (Bloc, StateNotifier).
  * Disallow widget → widget state passing (no mutable props).
  * Keep effects and side effects centralized.

→ *Architect’s insight:*
Leads to easier testability, time-travel debugging, and prevents UI glitches.

---

### 5️⃣ **WHY use Riverpod vs Bloc in different app sizes**

| App Size                | Riverpod                                                | Bloc                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Small / Medium          | Simpler, declarative, fewer files                       | Too verbose for tiny apps                  |
| Large (feature modules) | Strong modularization with `ProviderScope` override     | Good structure with Bloc architecture      |
| Complex flows           | Riverpod needs StateNotifier / AsyncNotifier for parity | Bloc excels with complex Event-State flows |
| Team size >5            | Bloc often easier to enforce consistent patterns        | Riverpod needs discipline to avoid misuse  |

→ *Architect’s insight:*
Bloc forces more boilerplate but protects junior devs.
Riverpod is faster to write but needs discipline.

---

### 6️⃣ **How to test state transitions**

* For Bloc:

```dart
blocTest<MyBloc, MyState>(
  'emits [Loading, Success] when X happens',
  build: () => MyBloc(...),
  act: (bloc) => bloc.add(MyEvent()),
  expect: () => [MyLoadingState(), MySuccessState()],
);
```

* For Riverpod:

```dart
test('StateNotifier emits states correctly', () {
  final container = ProviderContainer();
  final notifier = container.read(myNotifierProvider.notifier);
  ...
});
```

* Key:

  * Always test **state transitions, not UI details**.
  * Mock dependencies (Repo/Service).
  * Use golden tests for UI snapshots if needed.

---

### 7️⃣ **How to profile Flutter apps**

* **DevTools → Performance tab**

  * See Frame Timeline: build, layout, paint, raster.
  * Identify long frames (>16.6ms).
* **Memory tab**

  * Detect leaks, GC pauses.
* **Analyze size**

  * `flutter build apk --analyze-size`.
* **Release mode benchmarks**

  * `flutter run --profile`.

→ *Architect’s insight:*
Profile both CPU-bound (isolate) and GPU-bound (paint) paths.

---

### 8️⃣ **Understands GC behavior in Dart**

* Dart uses **generational garbage collection**:

  * Young → short-lived objects.
  * Old → long-lived objects.
* **Frequent rebuilds** → create many temp objects → hit GC.
* Bad patterns:

  * Over-creating animation controllers, streams.
  * Forgetting to close controllers → leaks.

→ *Architect’s insight:*
Watch allocations in DevTools, reduce short-lived object churn.

---

### 9️⃣ **How Flutter composes Scenes & Layers**

* After paint, **RenderObjects emit Layers**:

  * OpacityLayer
  * TransformLayer
  * ClipRectLayer
  * PictureLayer (actual drawing)
* SceneBuilder assembles Layer tree → sends Scene to GPU (Skia).
* Efficient scenes = fewer Layers → better GPU performance.

→ *Architect’s insight:*
Excessive layers (nested Clips, Opacity, Transforms) → more overdraw → jank.

---

### 🔟 **How to fix frame drops, memory leaks, jank**

* Profile where time is spent:

  * Build: optimize widget rebuilds.
  * Layout: fix over-constrained widgets.
  * Paint: reduce overdraw, layer count.
* Memory:

  * Close all Streams, AnimationControllers.
  * Use RepaintBoundary where needed.
  * Remove offscreen expensive widgets (offstage, lazy loading).
* Compute:

  * Move heavy work off main isolate.
  * Use compute() or isolate.

→ *Architect’s insight:*
Good perf = balance CPU (build/layout) and GPU (paint/raster).
Leaks = forgotten controllers, retained elements, big caches.
